MitchServ was a simple pseudoserver written for unrealircd (originally for the network IotaIRC, now ElectronIRC). The protocol that
this pseudoserver is unrealircd protocol number 2309, but it is compatable
with newer versions of UnrealIRCd.

How to set up (on debian):
git clone https://github.com/soccermitchy/mitchserv.git
cd mitchserv
sudo apt-get install lua luarocks nano
luarocks install luasocket
cp conf.json.example conf.json
nano conf.json


Running is as simple as this:
lua init.lua

If you want it to be a bit faster: 
luac init.lua -o init.luac
lua init.lua

To kill it, just do /msg MitchServ >shutdown
Lua code could be run by /msg MitchServ >lua (code)

To give yourself permissions, edit all the files in src/services and 
replace "wolfmitchell" or usr=="iota" -- with your nickname, in quotes.
You may have to tweak some stuff from src/services/welcome.lua for 
it to work properly.
